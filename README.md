# Learning Tokens

Learning Tokens is a project aimed at recognizing and rewarding community engagement in collective learning through the use of tokens. The project utilizes a hybrid token system that combines fungible and non-fungible token characteristics to incentivize and certify the acquisition of skills and competencies within learning communities.

## Introduction

Learning Tokens provide a positive reinforcer for valuable behaviors that contribute to the growth and development of individuals and learning communities. By utilizing a token system, the project aims to create an environment that fosters engagement, collaboration, and continuous learning. The tokens act as tangible representations of community engagement and skills acquisition, offering participants recognition and rewards for their contributions.

## Token Characteristics

Learning Tokens have the following characteristics:

- Token Type: Two types of tokens, fungible and non-fungible.
- Token Unit: Singleton, with no subdivision.
- Value Type: Intrinsic, the token itself holds value.
- Representation Type: Common for fungible engagement rewards, unique for non-fungible certificates.
- Template Type: Single for engagement rewards without child tokens, hybrid with a single parent and multiple child tokens for certificates in learning paths.

## Token Properties

The Learning Tokens possess the following properties:

- Behavioral Property: The value of the tokens is determined through logic and calculation, established and reviewed periodically by community consensus.
- Transferability: Tokens for engagement rewards are transferable, while certificates of learning are non-transferable.
- Indivisible/Whole: Both rewards and certificates are indivisible.
- Minting: The ability to issue new tokens for both types.
- Role Support: Tokens can have defined roles to allow or prevent specific actions.
- Burnable: The ability to remove Learning Tokens from the supply.

## Collaborations

The Learning Tokens project benefits from collaborations with esteemed organizations such as Hyperledger and the Global Blockchain Business Association (GBBA). These partnerships provide a strong foundation and access to resources and expertise, fostering innovation and driving the project's success.

## Implementation

To implement the Learning Tokens project, we will utilize tools and artifacts provided by the Interwork Alliance Token Taxonomy Framework (IWA TTF). We will also leverage open-source repositories such as eThaler, NEFERTI, and the IWA Github repositories for artifacts. These resources will enable us to define common token concepts, establish the token mechanism, and effectively measure the impact and benefits to learning communities.

## Future Opportunities

Learning Tokens present exciting opportunities for communities and individuals. By incentivizing engagement and collaboration, the tokens create a culture of continuous learning, skill development, and knowledge sharing. They act as valuable credentials, certifying the acquisition of skills and competencies, and showcasing an individual's growth within their respective learning communities.
